##🎞 Project Overview
As a business analyst, I conducted an end-to-end analysis of the Pizza Sales Dataset, which is designed to analyze transactional sales data from a pizza store. The goal is to identify key business insights, trends, and KPIs that will help management make informed decisions related to sales, marketing, and operations.
Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn), I processed, analyzed, and visualized the data to answer critical business questions.

##📚 Key Analyses & Insights:
✅Total revenue = $817K)
✅ Total orders = 21,350 
✅Average order value = $38.31
✅Average Pizza Order = 2.32.
✅The Large (L) Classic pizzas perform the best, accounting for 10.7% of all sales.

##🏆 Top  Performer
✅The Classic Deluxe Pizza and the Barbecue Chicken Pizza are strong all-around performers. The Thai Chicken Pizza generates the most revenue, likely due to a higher unit price, even though it's not the most frequently ordered.

##📉 Low  Performer
✅The Brie Carre Pizza is the lowest performer, ranking last in total revenue, quantity sold, and number of orders. This pizza, along with The Green Garden, Spinach Pesto, Calabrese, and The Mediterranean pizzas, consistently fails to perform. These five are clear candidates for menu removal to streamline operations and reduce inventory costs.

##📈 Daily Trends
✅Friday is the busiest day of the week, generating the most orders (3,538) and the highest revenue (approx. $137k). 
✅Sunday is the slowest day for both orders (2,504) and revenue.

##🕒 Hourly Trends
✅The day has two distinct peaks. The lunch rush, peaking at 12 PM (2,576 orders), is the busiest hour. A second, major dinner rush occurs between 5 PM and 7 PM, peaking at 6 PM (2,384 orders).
✅ Sales are lowest in the mid-afternoon (around 3 PM) and drop off significantly after 10 PM.

##🗓️ Monthly Trends
✅ July is the best-performing month, with the highest number of orders (1,935) and the most revenue (approx. $72k).
✅ October is the slowest month, with 1,623 orders
